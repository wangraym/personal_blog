Javascript is a scary thing for someone who's largely been a Python scripter since high school. Welcome to my first post on this platform! I made this website for a few reasons:

1) Chance to learn Javascript (Gatsby.js, Node.js, React.js)
2) Better document the work I've done and contribute it publicly. I don't know how many times I've gotten help from reading posts like these on the internet for projects in school and at work.

Thanks for stopping by. Check out my github at the link below:
